It was a beautiful morning in Syracuse, where everyone in the grand temple of Athena was busy preparing for a very important feast.

“Haste, haste! Lord Amiran is already headed to the altar! Quick! Put on your best armour!” wise Apollodorus rushed the soldiers who were all a little panicked by their appearance. The servants helped them don their bronze cuirasses. The plates were formed into a beautiful shape of muscles, glorifying the ideal human body.

“Teacher, we just won the battle against Argos. Why can’t my troops be presented as the best?” Arete questioned the old man. She felt hurt by Apollodorus’s decision.

“My Lady, go find something else to do! I’m very busy! Emperor Nero could arrive anytime now!” he shooed Arete away.

“My men are going to be very disappointed by that!” Arete shouted, but Apollodorus ignored her and walked away.

“It’s okay, Ma’am. We are happy to stay in Syracuse to serve you!” a soldier tried to cheer her up. His name was Arctus. He wore a linothorax with an ornate belt, a symbol indicating his rank as the Tagmatarkhis, a major under Arete’s command.

“Well, I’m glad that you guys are okay with it.” Arete smiled.

“Ma’am, are we going to meet up with Chlorus tonight for a reunion? I heard that he gained some great success in Rome,” another soldier asked. Petraeus was his name. He was the Lokhagos, captain of Arete’s troop.

Arete answered with a smile: “Well, okay, you guys should have a reunion. But count me out. I must attend the dinner with the officials tonight.”
