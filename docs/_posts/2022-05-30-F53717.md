After his mother perishes in an earthquake, Oscar Vélázquez moves to San Fransisco to live with his eccentric Uncle Killian. Uncle Killian has three rules: 1. Always be home for dinner. 2. Family doesn’t lie. And 3. Don’t go out on a full moon. 
Oscar soon learns about the world of witchcraft, magical creatures and a looming threat. Before he can learn to control his magic, Uncle Killian goes missing and it’s up to Oscar and his friends to find him.
