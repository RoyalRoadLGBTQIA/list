Malle HÃ¤marik is a vampire who understands the modern world well for an ancient creature. She's found her niche as a contract killer, but there are always those who would end her if they had the chance. Things fray further when her twisted heart gives itself away to a heartbroken jazz singer with nothing left to lose.
