After being kicked out of her party, Andra von Ekko, a self-obsessed thief with no sense of subtlety, decides to create one of her own along with the worst adventurers her guild has to offer. Will they find the fame and fortune Andra seeks? Or will they become the next meal for the first demon they encounter?
