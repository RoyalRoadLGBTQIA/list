Comedy, Contemporary, Romance, School Life, Slice of Life Russell is a virtuous goth with a Christian upbringing. Sal is a carefree slack-off who would rather work retail than go to college. It was hate at first sight. Until they were forced to partner up in class. After their true feelings surface, Sal learns just how different he is from Russell.
