Yuri, Comedy, High Fantasy, Short Story, Non-Human LeadWhen a Creature of the Void fails to find friendship among her own kind, she instead sets her sights upon another, human-filled world. Unfortunately, humans turn out to be rather small and squishy things, resulting in a mostly accidental trail of death, destruction and madness.
