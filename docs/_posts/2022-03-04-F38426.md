LGBT+, Contemporary, Romance, Multiple Lead Characters, School Life Alex Wallen is the tall, blond, athletic cheerleader everyone loves.
Nancy Campbell-Park is the nerd who wears glasses and gets shoved in the hallway for no reason.
When the both of them collide, they can't help but wonder if maybe, just maybe, this could actually work.
