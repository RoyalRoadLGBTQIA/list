Sci-fi, Genetically Engineered, Multiple Lead Characters, Non-Human Lead
Rakkel arrives in Forash City with nothing but the contents of xir messenger bag and a desire to see the legendary Forash Marketplace.
The only catch is that xir body was long ago converted to that of an anthropomorphic lemur.
