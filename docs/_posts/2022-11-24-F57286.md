After an accident involving a truck, Liz wakes up in a world she once thought existed only a video game, as the Evil Dragon Demon Queen no less. She has no idea what to do, where she is, or what's going on. She's not the brightest, or the bravest, the coolest or the most cunning. But she cares, deeply, truly and powerfully, and she's not stopping until she's done everything she can for everyone who needs it.
