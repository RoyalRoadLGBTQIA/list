Jack's life was never perfect, but a run-in with the criminal underbelly of Portswain has left him scarred. His memories are a patchwork he'll happily ignore, and his small handful of friends is good enough. When he meets antiques dealer Kieran, will he be able to ignore his instincts and give him a chance?
