For Jack, Erin, Rory, and Layla, the video game they play together every Saturday isn’t nearly as real or as threatening as the primal world of Ayrgard. Drawn across the darkness between realms for a mysterious purpose they’ll need to survive monsters, politics, and a lurking threat they can’t imagine.
