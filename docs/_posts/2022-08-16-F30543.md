Legend of the Galactic Heroes fanfiction. When Yang Wen-liâ€™s father dies, the only thing that he inherits is a mountain of debt. Yang flees his homeland and debt and takes up a false identity in the Galactic Empire, a hyper-stratified society where stepping out of line is punishable with imprisonment or death.
