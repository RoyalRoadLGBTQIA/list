The Earth has gone dark.
Marisa Lacerta finds her Martian colony of LaCei to have lost all communication with its host countries, and the colony is only months away from starvation. She must take up the mantle of diplomat and blaze a path to the other four colonies combining resources to sustain life. Unfortunately starvation and panic are not the only threats.
