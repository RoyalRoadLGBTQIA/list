Adventure, Fantasy, Mystery, Romance, Magic, Mythos Kiol is the Society's best soldier. He killed the Cult of Envy's leader and eradicated her nest. He chases down Nirin in the middle of a raid, the boy whose life he spared once already and finds himself inexplicably saving again. He feels a connection to Nirin unlike anything he's felt before, even knowing the boy is a cultist and a rebel.
