Protecting her younger brother, scars never healing. Separation of two, breaking free from her confinement. Coming upon a town, two sides of the same coin. One of peacefulness, another of horribleness. Differing from day and night, meeting one of kindness. Untrusting of others, steadily opening. Gal in finding one, traversing the horrors after the setting sun.
