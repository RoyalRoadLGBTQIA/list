And so, the Chosen One from the small farming village, sets off to begin his epic journey...
Ok, so "chosen one" might be misleading, since I picked Travis at random in what was totally not a fit of madness, and our "epic journey" is just him going to the capital to apply at the Mage's Academy, but he is being escorted by a Grizzled Veteran and Wise Wizard.
Granted, the "Grizzled Veteran" is just a guy in his 20's that literally can't grow a beard, and the "Wise Wizard" is really just me the talking sword. Oh, wait, maybe I should have started with that part...
