Polyarmory. WLW with romance but not romance-focused.
An interlocking story with several characters whose storylines entwine over a multiverse, with a couple of main characters as a focus. 
This series of stories and perspectives ultimately accounts the birth and life of a new god that goes under the moniker of The Matriarch. Born as a baseless deity, she seeks knowledge in all forms and supports learning. However, even scholars have enemies. In her bid to explore worlds and expand her knowledge, she runs into another godlike creature whos views seem to counter her own. As she works to combat this threat to the entire multiverse, she seeks to legalize certain forms of darker magic, spread her influence, and acquires a lover or two along the way.
