Fantasy, Female lead, LitRPG-lite, Necromancy
My village was burned to the ground by raiders and I'm forced to survive the wilds alone, overcoming the cold, hungry winters and fighting off the animals that are themselves looking for a meal. I rely on my necromancy, a magic my mother had me swear to never use, and learn other magics too, just to survive. What will I find returning to my village? What sort of world exists beyond it?
I seek to refine my strength and find a new home in this strange and violent world. This time, I won't let my home burn.
