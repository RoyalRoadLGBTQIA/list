Grew up an orphan and had to join the knights, swore to protect people so they didn't have to suffer what I did. Eventually succeeded at the cost of my life, and was offered a new life but there was a catch. I was cursed to become a spider, and now I'm just trying to find my way again with my first ever friend in a new world.
