Skyler Kadrix III wishes to set off on a journey to find the fabled Cyrstern, a skybeast unlike any other and the origin of the Crystals that grant people special abilities.
When he meets Finn, who came with his master in search of the same relic of the Ancients, Skyler finds his journey beginning.
