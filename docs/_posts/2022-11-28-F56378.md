Now the direct heir to the title of Count, my uncle forces his way into my home with intents to seize the title for himself. I find myself forced to grow my new powers to deal with his machinations, and to track down the man who murdered my family. Yet the world is not how I'd pictured it from within my families estate, the nobles do not live up to their ideals, the common people struggle under great burdens, and the other races, the elves, the dwarves, and the northern tribes, are not at all as my tutors described them.
Seeing the world for what it is while struggling with the changes forced upon me, I seek to learn who I am, and who I might become in this chaotic world of lies.
