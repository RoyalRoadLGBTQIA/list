Ryou, a relentlessly repressed accountant, accidentally slips between dimensions, right into the middle of a fight between a stranger and outlandish creatures. Since he's not a complete idiot, Ryou quickly retraces his steps and flees back to the normal world, but he brings the stranger along with him.
