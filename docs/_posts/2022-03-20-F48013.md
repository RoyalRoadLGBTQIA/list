Action, Fantasy, Female Lead, Grimdark, LitRPG, Post Apocalyptic
When the world ends, the apocalypse brought many things with it.
Most notably, monsters, magic, and a system that allows the survivers to gain the strength needed to survive.
In such a situation, Alice and her friend Ava somehow manage to survive, albeit barely.
But things start to change soon, to be precise, when Alice gets a call from her mother.
