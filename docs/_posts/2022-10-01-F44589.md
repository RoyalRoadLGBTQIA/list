Lourianne Tome is an underachieving, slightly lecherous summoner who wants to live a simple life. Those dreams are waylaid when a madman knocks her carriage off the road and sacrifices her. After a fateful encounter with a powerful elemental, Lou becomes something other than human and embarks on a journey.
