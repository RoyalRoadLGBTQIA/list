After losing her ship to pirates, Yvian Kiver finds herself apprenticed to an infamous human mercenary. Along with her sister, Yvian must learn the ways of the privateer, and help Captain Mims on his eternal quest to kill things for money. But the verse is bigger than Yvian knows, and she finds herself drawn into a conflict larger than she imagined.
