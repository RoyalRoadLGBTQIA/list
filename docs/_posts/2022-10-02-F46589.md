Action Adventure Fantasy 
The deserts of Yalmae are relentless: its sands are scorching by day and freezing by night, ready to consume any unprepared travellers.
A nameless man, known only as 'Sandhailer', sets out across the unforgiving dunes. His sole purpose is to deliver a message, and he has never failed to do so in time.
But when he finds a wounded soldier, he has to choose between his mission, and his morals.
